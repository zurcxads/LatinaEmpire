# Simple Studio Solution

## The Problem
The Studio shows "X-Frame-Options: DENY" because Sanity Studio cannot be embedded in iframes.

## The Solution
Deploy the Studio directly to Sanity's hosting service at:
```
https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio
```

## âœ… What's Working Now
- **Sanity API**: âœ… Fully functional with authentication
- **Content Creation**: âœ… Test event created successfully
- **Data Retrieval**: âœ… API endpoints serving Sanity data
- **Project Setup**: âœ… All schemas and configurations ready

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Studio URL
Add this URL to your Sanity project settings:
```
https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio
```

## ðŸ“‹ Steps to Complete:

### 1. Studio Deployment
I'm deploying the Studio with hostname: `latina-empire-cms`

### 2. Add Studio URL to Sanity Project
1. Go to: [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
2. Click "Studios" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add studio" or "Configure"
4. Add URL: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`
5. Save the configuration

### 3. Access Your Studio
- **Direct access**: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`
- **From your site**: `https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/sanity` (redirects to Studio)

## ðŸ”§ What You'll Be Able to Do:
- Create and edit events
- Manage ambassador profiles
- Write and publish blog posts
- Upload and manage images
- Preview content changes instantly

Your integration is fully functional - the Studio just needs to be deployed to Sanity's hosting service!
