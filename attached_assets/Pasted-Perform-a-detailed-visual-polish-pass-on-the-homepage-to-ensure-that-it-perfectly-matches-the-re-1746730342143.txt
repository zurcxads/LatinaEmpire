Perform a detailed visual polish pass on the homepage (/) to ensure that it perfectly matches the refined aesthetic and structural system now used across the rest of the site. This page sets the tone for the brand, so polish with care — maintaining existing visual impact while correcting layout, alignment, responsiveness, and spacing inconsistencies.

🔒 DO NOT ALTER:
✅ Hero Section (Hero.tsx)

Keep layout, background, typography, button styles, and scroll behavior intact.

✅ Testimonials Section (Testimonial.tsx)

Do not change layout, quote formatting, or imagery. This section is finalized.

🔄 REPLACE: PodcastSection.tsx → MediaSection.tsx
Create a new MediaSection to reflect the expanded blog/media presence on the site:

Title: Latina Empire In the Media
Description:
“Watch and read features about Latina Empire — from interviews and video reels to press stories that inspire.”

Display format:

3 content blocks (YouTube videos, blog features, press links)

Each block includes:

Thumbnail or placeholder

Title (max 2 lines, serif heading)

Source (e.g., YouTube, Forbes, Interview)

CTA: “Watch” or “Read” → external or internal route

CTA Button below:
“Explore Blog & Media” → /blog

✨ GLOBAL POLISH & REFINEMENT
🧱 Section Structure + Spacing
Apply consistent section-spacing utility to all sections

Ensure consistent top and bottom padding across all layout blocks

Confirm spacing above and below CTA blocks, including FinalCTA.tsx

🧭 Navbar + Hero
Ensure .hero-navbar-spacing is applied to prevent overlap

Confirm hero text stays vertically centered across all screen sizes

🎯 Buttons + CTAs
Confirm all buttons use the correct rounded-full format, hover styles, and color scheme

Verify all CTA buttons are functioning and routed properly (e.g., shop, join, events, programs)

Fix or replace any remaining placeholder buttons

📱 Mobile + Responsiveness
Test entire homepage on small screens (≤ 640px):

No horizontal scroll

Cards (programs, shop, media, events) collapse to single-column stacks

Padding/margins adapt to mobile without crowding or overlap

Ensure carousels are touch-friendly and don’t break layout

Make sure button groups (like in CTASection or FinalCTA) wrap cleanly on mobile

🧩 General Layout Consistency
Ensure all cards (Programs, Shop, Impact, Events) use the same:

Border radius

Drop shadow

Hover effect

Font sizing and hierarchy

Check carousel arrows, icons, and spacing are visually aligned

🖼 Visual Quality
Confirm all background gradients or image overlays maintain legibility and contrast

Use soft radial blur or brand-accented overlays to match /about-founder and /donate

✅ Final Checklist:
No layout overlaps or hero bleed issues

Buttons behave identically across sections

Spacing feels consistent with /programs, /leaders, /blog

Media section cleanly replaces podcast block

Mobile layout is tested and fully optimized
