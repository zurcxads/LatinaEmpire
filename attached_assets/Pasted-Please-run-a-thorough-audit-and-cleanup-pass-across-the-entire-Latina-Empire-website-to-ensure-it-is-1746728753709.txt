Please run a thorough audit and cleanup pass across the entire Latina Empire website to ensure it is fully functional, clean, visually consistent, and free from bugs or broken layouts.

Follow this audit checklist and apply necessary fixes:

ðŸ–¼ UI/UX & Layout Audit
Global Consistency

Ensure all pages follow the same design system as /about-founder and the homepage.

Typography: large serif headings, clean sans-serif body

Buttons: pill-shaped, bold font, hover glow

Images: blurred gradient overlays, rounded corners

Section spacing: consistent top/bottom padding across pages

Hero Sections

Every page with a hero section should use the same format:

Full-width block

Background gradient or image overlay

Large headline

Subheading

CTA (optional)

Check that hero sections never overlap the navbar, even when scrolling.

Navigation Bar

Ensure the navbar is always visible, sticky if needed, and not being cut off or covered by content.

Test scroll behavior across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Dropdowns open and close cleanly on hover/click.

No overlapping elements when opened.

Footer

Check that each page has only one footer instance.

Footer links are accurate and match the final sitemap structure.

Spacing between last page section and footer is consistent.

ðŸ”— Functionality & Routing Audit
404 / Not Found

Confirm a working, styled 404 page is in place.

Check for any broken routes or links that lead to a blank page.

Test all dynamic routes (/leaders/:slug, /blog/:slug, /events/:slug) to confirm proper rendering or fallbacks.

Missing Pages

Confirm all required pages from the final sitemap exist:

/, /about-founder, /leaders, /manahood, /manahood/start

/programs, /events, /events-calendar, /blog

/membership, /shop, /donate, /contact, /join

Button Links

Ensure all CTA buttons are connected to the correct routes or modals.

Buttons on /join, /membership, /manahood, etc. must go to /join or correct forms.

Forms

Validate that placeholder forms are styled correctly, responsive, and not broken

Confirm form submit buttons are functioning (even if not integrated yet)

ðŸ“± Responsiveness
Check all pages on mobile, tablet, and desktop widths

No horizontal scroll or overflow issues

Cards, grids, and carousels collapse cleanly

Dropdowns and modals are touch-friendly
