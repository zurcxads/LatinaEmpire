Tablet & Responsive Audit & Polish Prompt
Please run a complete audit and style optimization pass for all pages across tablet screen sizes (768px‚Äì1024px) and responsive breakpoints, including hybrid states like:

iPad Mini/Pro

Android tablets (Samsung, Lenovo, etc.)

Small laptops (1024x768 / 1280x800)

Browser windows resized between mobile and desktop

üîç RESPONSIVE AUDIT AREAS:
1. Layout Adjustments
Fix any awkward wrapping or crowding when content tries to stay side-by-side (like 2-column layouts).

Ensure text blocks, images, and buttons align cleanly within max-w-[width] containers.

Verify that no desktop 3‚Äì4 column grids are displayed on tablet ‚Äî convert to 2-column layout using:

tailwind
Copy code
grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
2. Navbar & Header Elements
Confirm sticky nav is:

Not cutting into section content

Scaling logo and nav items properly (no text overlap)

Collapse behavior (hamburger menu) works smoothly between 768‚Äì1024px

3. Section Spacing Consistency
Ensure padding and margin utility classes work responsively:

tailwind
Copy code
py-12 sm:py-16 md:py-20
px-6 sm:px-8 md:px-12
Prevent over-padding or under-padding on stacked sections.

4. CTA Buttons & Text Wrapping
All CTA blocks should:

Center or align left based on section intent

Maintain pill button shapes (rounded-full)

Avoid overlapping when two CTAs sit side-by-side

5. Image Containers
Audit images to:

Maintain correct aspect ratios

Scale proportionally (esp. hero background images)

Avoid float-offscreen or max-height clipping bugs

6. Text Blocks & Typography
Balance text sizes for legibility:

tailwind
Copy code
text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl
Adjust max-width on body text to improve line length on medium screens

7. Interactive Elements
Ensure carousels, sliders, and tabs respond correctly to touch and swipe on tablets

Fix any cutoff elements in horizontal scroll areas (media, testimonials, etc.)

8. Forms and Modals
Confirm input fields span usable width (60‚Äì90%)

Button placement and alignment inside forms must be optimized (stack vertically if space is limited)

Check modal behavior ‚Äî confirm they‚Äôre centered, scrollable, and not clipped

‚úÖ GOAL:
Deliver a clean, coherent, and touch-optimized experience across tablet devices and intermediate screens. It should visually echo the desktop design while respecting mobile-first structure.
