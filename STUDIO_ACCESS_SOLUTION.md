# Studio Access Solution

## The Issue
The Studio shows "X-Frame-Options: DENY" because it cannot be embedded in iframes.

## ✅ What's Working
- **Sanity API**: Fully functional with authentication
- **Content Creation**: Test event created successfully
- **Data Flow**: API endpoints serving Sanity content
- **Integration**: Complete backend setup

## 🎯 Immediate Solution

### Studio URL to Add to Sanity Project:
```
https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/sanity
```

### But You Should Access Studio Directly:
Instead of using the redirect, access your Studio directly through Sanity's interface:

1. **Go to your Sanity project**: [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
2. **Click "Studios"** in the left sidebar
3. **You should see your Studio URL listed there**
4. **Click it to access the Studio directly**

## 📋 Steps to Complete Setup:

### 1. Add Studio URL to Sanity Project
- Go to: [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
- Click "Studios" → "Add studio" 
- Add URL: `https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/sanity`
- Save configuration

### 2. Access Studio Through Sanity Dashboard
- In your Sanity project dashboard
- Click on the Studio link
- This will open the Studio in a new tab (not iframe)

## 🔧 Alternative Access Methods:

### Method 1: Direct Sanity Dashboard
- [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
- Click your Studio link from the dashboard

### Method 2: URL Redirect (if working)
- `https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/sanity`
- This redirects to the Studio

### Method 3: Local Studio (if needed)
- Run `npx sanity start` locally
- Access at `localhost:3333`

## 🧪 Test Your Integration:

### 1. API Test (Working):
```
https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/api/events
```

### 2. Content Management:
- Access Studio through Sanity dashboard
- Create content and see it appear on your site immediately

## 📈 Current Status:
- ✅ **API Integration**: Complete
- ✅ **Authentication**: Working
- ✅ **Content Creation**: Functional
- ✅ **Data Serving**: Active
- ⚠️ **Studio Access**: Use Sanity dashboard instead of iframe

Your integration is fully functional - just access the Studio through your Sanity project dashboard!
