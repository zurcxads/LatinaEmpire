Please perform a comprehensive mobile UI/UX audit across all pages of the Latina Empire site and apply refinements to ensure a smooth, visually aligned, and elegant experience on mobile devices (especially for screens 320px‚Äì768px wide).

üîç AUDIT FOCUS AREAS (By Priority):
1. Spacing & Section Padding
Ensure all sections have consistent top/bottom padding (pt-16 pb-16 or similar).

Prevent content from appearing squished or cramped on small screens.

Adjust any broken gap-* spacing between stacked elements (especially in grids, cards, or CTA blocks).

2. Text & Typography
Scale down headings and body text responsively using text-xl, text-2xl, sm:text-3xl etc.

Prevent long headlines from wrapping awkwardly (use leading-tight and tracking-normal where needed).

Fix any cases of text overflow or lines being cut off in buttons/cards.

3. Button Responsiveness
Ensure pill buttons stack or scale naturally (w-full sm:w-auto) and do not overflow their containers.

CTA buttons in sections like Hero, Quiz, Shop, and Footer should always be:

Centered

Tappable (minimum height/touch zone)

Stacked vertically when in a row of two

4. Image & Card Scaling
Ensure images and cards scale smoothly without cropping or awkward aspect ratios.

Audit media, product, and program cards ‚Äî make sure the gradient overlays, badges, and text adapt to smaller widths.

If card grids break into columns, use a 1-column or 2-column mobile layout with even spacing.

5. Navigation & Menu Behavior
Fix any mobile menu rendering issues (like double menus, scroll bleed, or hidden links).

The sticky navbar should remain fully visible and layered above hero content on scroll.

Confirm mobile dropdowns don‚Äôt overflow or shift other content.

6. Form Fields & CTAs
All form inputs should use w-full, be centered or padded well, and not overflow edge to edge.

Check modal forms like Join Empire and Newsletter for mobile-friendly input layout.

7. Rounded Container Consistency
Ensure all floating containers (e.g., Hero, Impact, Events) maintain their rounded-xl or rounded-2xl appearance.

No cropped corners or overflows.

8. Mobile Animation Glitches
Check for janky transitions, hover states that don‚Äôt translate to mobile, or stacked layers causing flickers.

Disable desktop hover effects if they're visually confusing on touch.

9. Scroll Behavior
Prevent horizontal scrollbars (overflow-x-hidden) globally and on nested containers.

Fix any overflow bugs caused by fixed-width containers, buttons, or images.
