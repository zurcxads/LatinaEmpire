# Studio Permission Fix

## The Problem
The Studio redirect isn't working due to iframe restrictions.

## Working Solution
Deploy the Studio directly to Sanity's hosting service.

## Status
- ✅ **Sanity API**: Working with authentication
- ✅ **Content Creation**: Test event created successfully
- ✅ **Integration**: Complete backend setup
- ⏳ **Studio Deployment**: Deploying to `latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`

## Once Deployed
You'll access your Studio at:
```
https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio
```

## Add to Your Sanity Project
1. Go to: [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
2. Click "Studios" → "Add studio"
3. Add URL: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`

## Test Your Integration
- **API**: `https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/api/events`
- **Studio**: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`

The Studio deployment is in progress and will provide direct access without iframe issues.
