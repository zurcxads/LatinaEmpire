Homepage Redesign to Match TonyRobbins.com Style)

Rebuild the Latina Empire homepage so that it visually matches the look and structure of TonyRobbins.com, based on the mobile screenshots provided. Focus on recreating:

SECTION 1: Hero Banner (Flagship Program Promo)
	•	Full-screen hero with:
	•	Background image or video (placeholder ok)
	•	Headline text in large white bold font: “Step Into Your Power”
	•	Subheadline below: “Join the Latina Empire Elite Program — our flagship experience for Latina transformation.”
	•	CTA button: “Join Now” — use rounded white button with dark text (like Tony Robbins)
	•	Button should open a modal form (Name, Email, Country, short answer)
	•	Use bold spacing, center-aligned typography, with white text overlay on dark image

⸻

SECTION 2: Next Event Promo Banner
	•	Just like Tony Robbins’ “NEXT EVENT” strip:
	•	Show image thumbnail on left
	•	Label: “NEXT EVENT”
	•	Event Title (placeholder): “Latina Empire LIVE Miami 2025”
	•	Subtitle: “In-person transformation, networking, and activation.”
	•	Button: “Get Tickets” — white outline button with magenta hover
	•	Optional play button overlay if a video is present
	•	Use black background section with white font

⸻

SECTION 3: Event Carousel (Slider for Multiple Programs)
	•	Horizontal slider showing programs like:
	•	Latina Empire ELITE
	•	Financial Freedom Bootcamp
	•	Business Accelerator
	•	Each card should have:
	•	Background image
	•	Program name
	•	Short subtitle
	•	Carousel dots below
	•	Tap or click expands details or links to program page

⸻

Typography & Styling:
	•	Font family must match or mimic TonyRobbins.com (use Neue Haas Grotesk or closest Google Font: Poppins, Inter, or custom import).
	•	Font sizes, spacing, and weight must follow exact spacing model from the screenshots.
	•	Layout must match: wide hero → event strip → horizontal carousel
	•	CTA buttons: white with black text, bold, rounded

⸻

Technical:
	•	Build this with mobile-first responsiveness.
	•	Structure each section as reusable React components.
	•	Do not use placeholder blocks — build each section visually accurate even with fake data.
