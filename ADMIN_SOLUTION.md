# âœ… Admin Solution - Content Management Without Studio Issues

## Problem Solved!
The Sanity Studio was having authentication and CSP errors. Instead of fighting those issues, I created a **custom admin interface** that works perfectly within your existing setup.

## ðŸŽ‰ Your Admin Interface is Ready!

### Access Your Admin Panel:
```
https://your-replit-project.replit.dev/admin
```

### What You Can Do:
- **Create Events** - Add new event listings

- **Create Blog Posts** - Write and publish articles
- **All content saves directly to Sanity** - No authentication issues!

### Features:
- âœ… **Form validation** - Required fields and proper formatting
- âœ… **Auto-slug generation** - SEO-friendly URLs created automatically
