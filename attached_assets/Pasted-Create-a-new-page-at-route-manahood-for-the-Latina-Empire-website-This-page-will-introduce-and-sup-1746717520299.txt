Create a new page at route /manahood for the Latina Empire website. This page will introduce and support local “Manahood” chapters — vibrant sisterhood communities. Use modern, minimalist styling consistent with the rest of the site: black/white backgrounds, soft gradients, bold headings, and magenta accents (#D81B60).

Page Sections and Structure:
1. Hero Section — What is Manahood?
Full-width block with gradient or branded background

Heading (Large):
“Welcome to the Manahood”

Subheading:
“A powerful sisterhood of Latinas leading with heart, purpose, and legacy.”

Short paragraph introducing the concept of Manahood

Optional: Add background blur image or gradient with transparent text card

2. Searchable Map + Chapter Directory
Section title: “Find a Manahood Near You”

Add a map placeholder (later to be powered by Mapbox or Google Maps)

Include a simple search bar or dropdown filter (e.g. by city/state/zip)

Below the map, include a directory grid or list of existing chapters:

Chapter name

City/state

“View Details” button or leader info

3. Meet the Leaders
Section title: “Meet the Women Leading the Movement”

Grid of Leader Cards:

Image (placeholder)

Full-width CTA block with magenta background

Heading: “Ready to Lead?”

Short inspiring blurb: “If you’ve felt the call to lead other Latinas in your city, we’ve made it simple.”

5. Upcoming Manahood Events
Section title: “Manahood Gatherings Near You”
