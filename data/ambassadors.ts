    fullBio: "Elena Rodriguez founded Latina Empire in 2018 after a 15-year corporate career where she rose to become a VP of Marketing at a Fortune 500 company. Throughout her career, Elena often found herself as the only Latina in the boardroom and recognized the need for a community that specifically addressed the unique challenges faced by Latina professionals.\n\nBorn to Dominican immigrants in New York City, Elena worked her way through college as the first in her family to pursue higher education. After graduating with honors from New York University with a degree in Business Administration, she joined a major consumer goods company and quickly climbed the corporate ladder.\n\nDespite her success, Elena experienced firsthand the cultural and systemic barriers that many Latinas face in professional settings: from microaggressions to lack of mentorship and limited networking opportunities. In 2018, she left her corporate position to create Latina Empire with a mission to build a community where Latina professionals could find support, mentorship, and practical tools to advance their careers.\n\nUnder Elena's leadership, Latina Empire has grown to serve over 50,000 Latina professionals across the United States and Latin America through events, coaching programs, and online resources. She is particularly passionate about helping Latinas negotiate their worth, develop executive presence, and build strategic networks.\n\nElena holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and serves on the boards of several nonprofit organizations focused on education and economic opportunities for underrepresented communities. She has been recognized as one of Fortune's 40 Under 40 and Hispanic Executive's Top 10 Líderes. When not working on growing Latina Empire, Elena enjoys salsa dancing, exploring Miami's food scene, and mentoring young Latinas in her community.",

    shortBio: "Carmen transitioned from a successful corporate career to entrepreneurship, founding two small businesses before joining Latina Empire. She specializes in helping Latinas navigate the startup ecosystem.",
    fullBio: "Carmen Vega brings over a decade of entrepreneurial experience to her role as Business Development Director at Latina Empire. After beginning her career in management consulting with Boston Consulting Group, Carmen took the leap into entrepreneurship and founded two successful businesses: a direct-to-consumer skincare line influenced by her Mexican heritage and a business strategy consultancy focused on helping Latina-owned businesses scale.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles to Mexican parents, Carmen grew up helping in her family's small restaurant, where she developed a deep understanding of the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship from an early age. This foundation, combined with her formal education in Economics and Business from UCLA, gives her a unique perspective on the intersection of cultural heritage and business success.\n\nCarmen joined Latina Empire in 2020 to lead the organization's entrepreneurship initiatives. She developed the Empire Accelerator, a 12-week intensive program that has helped over 200 Latina founders secure funding and scale their businesses. Her work focuses particularly on addressing the significant funding gap for Latina entrepreneurs, who receive less than 0.5% of venture capital despite being the fastest-growing group of small business owners in the United States.\n\nAs a sought-after speaker on entrepreneurship and funding strategies, Carmen has presented at South by Southwest, the United State of Women Summit, and numerous business schools. She is passionate about demystifying the startup ecosystem and creating accessible pathways for Latinas to build wealth through business ownership.\n\nCarmen serves as a mentor with Techstars and is on the advisory board of Digital Undivided. In her free time, she enjoys hiking the trails around Los Angeles, experimenting with new recipes that blend her Mexican heritage with California cuisine, and mentoring young entrepreneurs from underserved communities.",
