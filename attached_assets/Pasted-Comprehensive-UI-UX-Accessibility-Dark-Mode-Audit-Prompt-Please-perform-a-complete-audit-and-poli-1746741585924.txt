Comprehensive UI/UX, Accessibility & Dark Mode Audit Prompt
Please perform a complete audit and polish pass across the entire Latina Empire website focusing on the following areas:

📱🔁 RESPONSIVENESS: All Breakpoints
✅ Mobile (≤ 767px), Tablet (768px–1023px), Desktop (≥ 1024px)
Audit each section for:

Proper spacing and padding across breakpoints (px, py, gap)

Responsive text sizes:

tailwind
Copy code
text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-4xl
Grid systems adjusting from 1 → 2 → 3 columns cleanly:

tailwind
Copy code
grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
Fix any:

Text wrapping/overflow issues

Image ratio distortion

CTA button stacking or misalignment

Scrollable horizontal sections cutting off on tablet

🎯 ACCESSIBILITY (A11y) Compliance
Audit and apply fixes for:

1. Color Contrast
Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large headlines)

Especially check:

Gradient overlays over text

Button text on magenta/dark backgrounds

2. Alt Tags for All Images
Every image (<img> or next/image) must include alt="" text, even if decorative

3. ARIA Labels and Roles
Apply aria-label, aria-labelledby, or role attributes to:

Navigation elements

Modals

Form fields

Tabs/accordions

4. Keyboard Navigation
Ensure all interactive elements (e.g. links, buttons, tabs) are:

Focusable with tab

Usable via keyboard alone

5. Skip to Content
Add a "skip to content" link for screen reader users (placed at the top of page, visually hidden but accessible)

🌙 DARK MODE SUPPORT
Ensure the entire site works cleanly in dark mode, including:

✅ Backgrounds
All section backgrounds must toggle appropriately:

bg-white dark:bg-black

Avoid harsh shifts — use Tailwind's dark: variants for smooth toggles

✅ Text
Apply conditional text styles:

tailwind
Copy code
text-gray-900 dark:text-white
✅ Buttons, Cards & Borders
Ensure pills, outlines, and border colors adjust:

border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700

hover:bg-neutral-800 dark:hover:bg-neutral-600

✅ Image Blending
For sections using background images:

Apply an overlay or dark filter for better legibility in dark mode (bg-black/30)

OR offer dark: image variants if possible

🧪 TEST ALL PAGES
Test every major route:

/, /about-founder, /programs, /events, /blog, /membership, /contact, and any modals or dynamic routes

Validate:

No layout shifts on resize

All UI is visually polished

All buttons/CTAs work

Pages are navigable and readable with screen readers
