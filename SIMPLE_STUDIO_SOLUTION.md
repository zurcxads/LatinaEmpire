# Simple Studio Solution - No Permissions Issues

## Problem Identified
You're getting "Insufficient permissions" because your account doesn't have admin access to that specific Sanity project.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Use the Built-in Content Manager (Recommended)
1. **Go to**: [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
2. **Look for "Content" tab** in the left sidebar
3. **Click "Content"** - this opens content management without needing Studio
4. **If no Content tab**: Your project needs schemas deployed

### Option 2: Create Your Own Studio URL
Instead of using the Sanity-hosted Studio, create your own:

1. **In your Sanity project "Add studio" dialog**, use:
   ```
   https://your-replit-project-name.replit.dev/studio
   ```
   
2. **This will point to your own Studio** (which we'll set up)

### Option 3: Deploy Your Own Studio
Let me help you deploy a Studio that you control:

1. **Run this in your terminal**:
   ```bash
   npx sanity deploy --source-maps
   ```
   
2. **When prompted for hostname**: `latina-empire-cms`
   
3. **This creates**: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`

## Why This Happens
- The project owner needs to invite you as an admin
- Or you need to create your own Studio instance
- Or use the Content tab instead of Studio

## Quick Test
Let's verify your API is working:
1. Go to your website
2. Check if events load (even if empty)
3. If they do, your integration is perfect - you just need Studio access

## Best Solution
**Create your own Studio** - you'll have full control and no permission issues.
