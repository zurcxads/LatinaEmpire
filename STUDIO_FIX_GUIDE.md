# Studio X-Frame-Options Fix

## Problem
The Studio shows "X-Frame-Options: DENY" error because Sanity Studio cannot be embedded in iframes.

## Solution
We need to deploy the Studio directly to Sanity's hosting service instead of redirecting.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Sanity Integration**: Working with API
- ✅ **Authentication**: Token configured
- ✅ **Test Content**: Successfully created
- ⚠️ **Studio Access**: Needs direct deployment

## Fixed Studio URL
Once deployed, use this URL in your Sanity project settings:
```
https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio
```

## Steps to Complete Setup:

### 1. Deploy Studio to Sanity Hosting
I'm deploying the Studio with hostname: `latina-empire-cms`

### 2. Add Studio URL to Sanity Project
- Go to: [sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk](https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3yaebsnk)
- Click "Studios" → "Add studio"
- Add URL: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`

### 3. Update Your Site's Studio Link
Instead of `/sanity` redirecting to an iframe, it will redirect to the fully hosted Studio.

## What This Fixes:
- ❌ **iframe embedding** (causes X-Frame-Options error)
- ✅ **Direct Studio access** (full functionality)
- ✅ **Proper authentication** (Sanity handles login)
- ✅ **Complete feature set** (all Studio tools available)

## Access Points:
- **Direct Studio**: `https://latina-empire-cms.sanity.studio`
- **Your Site Redirect**: `https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/sanity`
- **Studio Info API**: `https://latina-empire-jose283.replit.app/sanity-info`

The Studio will work properly once deployed to Sanity's hosting service!
